/*5Investigate CAST and CONVERT functions.
 Explain the differences if any, write examples based on sakila DB.
 Cast Function: converts a value of any type into the specified datatype.
 Syntax: CAST(value AS datatype)
 Convert Fnction: converts a value into the specified datatype or character set.
 Syntax: CONVERT(value, type) OR CONVERT(value USING charset)
 Differences:
 Apart from their syntax, Convert and Cast functions have some differences:
-CONVERT can be used to convert data between character sets. Ej: CONVERT(title USING latin1)
-CAST is part of the ANSI-SQL specification(runs in all modern vendor databases).
 Whereas, CONVERT is not.CONVERT is SQL implementation-specific.
https://sqlandplsql.com/2011/11/20/what-is-ansi-sql/
Types that can be used:
DATE	Converts value to DATE. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD"
DATETIME	Converts value to DATETIME. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
DECIMAL	Converts value to DECIMAL. Use the optional M and D parameters to specify the maximum number of digits (M) and the number of digits following the decimal point (D).
TIME	Converts value to TIME. Format: "HH:MM:SS"
CHAR	Converts value to CHAR (a fixed length string)
NCHAR	Converts value to NCHAR (like CHAR, but produces a string with the national character set)
SIGNED	Converts value to SIGNED (a signed 64-bit integer)
UNSIGNED	Converts value to UNSIGNED (an unsigned 64-bit integer)
BINARY

/*6 Investigate NVL, ISNULL, IFNULL, COALESCE, etc type of function.
 Explain what they do. Which ones are not in MySql and write usage examples.
IFNULL(): lets you return an alternative value if the expression is null
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products; 
(supported by mysql)
COALESCE: returns the first non-NULL argument. In case all arguments are NULL,
returns NULL:
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, 0);  -- 0
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL); -- NULL
(supported by mysql)
ISNULL() function lets you return an alternative value when an expression is NULL:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + ISNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;
(supported by sqlserver)
IsNull() function returns TRUE (-1) if the expression is a null value, otherwise FALSE (0):
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IIF(IsNull(UnitsOnOrder), 0, UnitsOnOrder))
FROM Products;
(supported by MS Access)
NVL() function achieves the same result:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + NVL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;
 (supported by oracle)
