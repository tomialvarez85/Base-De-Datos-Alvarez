#A materialized view simplifies complex data by saving query information.
#The principal use like the view is to optimize data but what is the biggest differences
#between the normal view is that a materialized view is much more efficient at executing queries.
#The data is physically saved at a specific point in time.
#So the data to be saved the time is less and for mysql or the data base motor you are using it
#dont have to re-read the data every time you have executed the query.
